# Sonpari-Tales-Alexa-Skill


# About
**Note:** We developed this skill targeting kid of age 3-7 yr. 
This skill represents herself as a fairy named Sonpari who tells new stories every day. But the problem is that Sonpari talks only with good kids. 
To check kid is behaving well or not, Sonpari asks a new question every day to Kid. If kid replies correctly, Sonpari rewards him/her with a story. And if kid replies wrong, Sonpari explains why that thing is wrong and asks the kid to promise that he won't do this again.
If kid promises, Sonpari plays story else It says- 'I don't talk with bad kids. come back when you become a good kid to listen to the story'.
